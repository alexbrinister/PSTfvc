# TfvcImproved
## Summary
Improved PowerShell cmdlets for working with Team Foundation Version Control.

## Details
This project aims to create a PowerShell equivalent to `tf.exe`. This executable is _the_ best way to use TFVC without
getting involved with the C# API. However, `tf.exe` is not great when used with automated scripts because its output is
text. `TfvcImproved` offers native .NET object output that can be used in PowerShell pipelines and scripts to maximize
automation of Team Foundation Version Control
